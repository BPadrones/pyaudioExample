# pyaudioExample
testing with pyaudio to get a .wav file to play
## Requirements
python
pyaudio library
## How to setup
This is mainly a toy script so I would recommend created a virtual environment to download the nessary libraries so that 
your environment dosen't get too messy.
you can run "python -m venv foldername"  to create a virtual with python then go into the /scripts folder and run the activate script(on windows activate.bat)
then run "pip install PyAudio" and finally run the python script. The script will take an argument that is a .wav file so running the script is
"python pyaudioEx.py file.wav"
